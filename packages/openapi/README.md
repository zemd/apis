# @zemd/openapi

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@zemd/openapi?color=0000ff&label=npm&labelColor=000)](https://npmjs.com/package/@zemd/openapi)

The package provides a typescript types and a set of utilities to work with OpenAPI Specification. The types and the tools aimed to help to avoid mistakes and provide a better developer experience when working with the OpenAPI Specification. This also means that implementation might or might not be in the form that you might expect, but it should be more convenient to work with.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @zemd/openapi
```

## Usage

TBD.

## The promise

The package is developed for the personal needs and is not intended to support all versions of the OpenAPI Specification. Also, in my opinion, there is no need for projects to support old version of their api, especially if they update dependencies(or just stick with the version you need). Howbeit, I do not have capacity to support this package alone, and my main focus always will be exclusively on supporting the latest versions of the OpenAPI Specification. Currently, the package should support the version `3.1.1`.
